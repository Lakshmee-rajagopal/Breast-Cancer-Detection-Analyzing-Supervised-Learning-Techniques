# Breast Cancer Detection: Analyzing Supervised Learning Techniques

**Goal of the Project**

The goal of this project is to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer detection by applying various supervised learning techniques to analyze the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library.


**Overview of the Project**

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning to improve breast cancer detection through several key steps:

Loading and Preprocessing: We load the breast cancer dataset from sklearn, followed by preprocessing to address missing values and perform necessary feature scaling for optimal model performance.

Classification Algorithm Implementation: Five classification algorithms are implemented to identify patterns and classify the data: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Model Comparison: After implementing the algorithms, their performance is compared to determine which method is most effective in accurately detecting breast cancer. This analysis reveals the best and worst performing models, contributing to the understanding of how different approaches can aid in cancer detection.

The aim of this project is to leverage machine learning to enhance diagnostic capabilities in the medical field, specifically for breast cancer.
