# SUPERVISED-MACHINE-LEARNING-MODELS

The objective of this project is to evaluate my understanding and ability to apply supervised learning techniques to a real-world dataset. The dataset taken is the breast cancer dataset available in the sklearn library.

The key components that are fulfilled :

1. Loading and Preprocessing
Loaded the breast cancer dataset from sklearn.
Preprocessed the data to handle missing values and performed necessary feature scaling.

2. Classification Algorithm Implementation
Implemented the following five classification algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

3. Model Comparison
Compared the performance of the five classification algorithms.
Given the result of which algorithm performed the best and which one performed the worst.
